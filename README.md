# Security Question Checker
Capstone Project
## Overview
I will be creating a website that will use the users social media accounts to scan for answers to security questions. This will be done using Facebook and Twitters developers API. Using their API's I can scan the users profile information and posts for information that can be used to answer security questions. I will being using a list of security questions to look for potential answers also I will being looking at the information set on the users dashboard that could answer some security questions, for example Facebook profiles have education history, relationships, and other personal information that can be set and scanned. Based on the information gathered a report will be returned to the user alerting them to potential exposure of security question answers. This report will also tell the user if they have settings that help protect them against this kind of attack.

Using certain words that are used to answer the top common security questions we can then look for those words in the users post, for instance if a security question asks "What is your pets name?", we can search for posts containing names of animals in the text. This system can be used for other questions also. Some questions do not require searching posts and only require looking at the users 'Profile Information', for instance a question that asks "What high school did you attend?" can be answered by looking at the Facebook profile education section.

Combining all of these systems I think I can make a website that people can used to check their security posture in regards to Security Question and Social Engineering. Providing a preventative platform allows for people to know if they are vulnerable before they are hacked. This type of platform is superior to other types that would only let you know if you have been hacked previously.

## Problem
Modern day use of social media opens up vulnerabilities in security questions as a form of authentication. Personal Information posted by people online can be used to answer security questions for their accounts, thus granting access to the attacker. This attack technique can also be coupled with phishing and social engineering. There currently isn't a platform that gives users insight on their social media standing in regards to security questions.

## Research Question
Can a tool be created to let users know if their social media information can be used to answer security questions about them?
